Hi, I'm Kai. People address me as they/them. The language to describe what I'd like to do hasn't quite been worked out yet, but let me try to sum it up. I like to call myself an aspiring quantitative urbanist, or computational social scientist. I'm passionate about cities, economic geography, machine learning, and complex systems.

<br/>

I graduated from Vassar College in 2019, where my major was mathematics and my minor was urban studies. In my time at Vassar, I tried to accumulate what I believe is a quantitative social science toolset. I wrote a senior thesis in economics, which explored the relationship between the geographic shape of economic segregation and intergenerational mobility, specifically focusing on how economic segregation ought to be measured. I want to be a part of bridging the divide between the social sciences and the computational and mathematical sciences. In doing so, I believe an important part of this gap is figuring out the best ways to measure things that aren't directly observable, like segregation, gerrymandering, or social capital. 

<br/>

Now, I'm spending two years at Harvard University's <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org/">Opportunity Insights</a>, where I am working as a pre-doctoral fellow making use of my skills in econometrics and machine learning to study economic opportunity and how to impact it in the United States. I plan on applying to PhD programs in the fall of 2020. 

<br/>

I love to bond over shared passions, so please reach out if any of this speaks to you!

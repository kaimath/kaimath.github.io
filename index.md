Hi, I’m Kai! People address me using they/them pronouns. I think of myself as computationally driven and social sciences oriented. In my career, my goal is to help bridge the divides between the social sciences and the computational and mathematical sciences, in realms from sociology to policy implementation. It is my desire to equip communities with the information and resources they need to better their lives.

This reflects in the work I do. As a data visualization specialist at Accenture Federal Services, I aid in effectively carrying out social welfare programs that affect the quality of life of so many throughout the country. Previously, I was an economics predoctoral fellow at Harvard, where I conducted academic research on many of the same social welfare programs that I now interact with at work. 

Working directly with the agencies that administer these programs aids me in understanding how the programs play out and impact communities. Whether through academic research or on-the-ground contributions, I carry with me a passion for social interventions that can address systemic inequality. 

I graduated from Vassar College in 2019, where I studied mathematics and urban studies. In my time at Vassar, I strived to be an interdisciplinarian, earning me a prize in multidisciplinary studies and the opportunity to house my thesis in the economics department. My thesis touched on my passions for measurement and neighborhood change by exploring the relationship between the geographic shape of economic segregation and intergenerational mobility. I see a future for myself in which I continue to engage with these topics, whether through a PhD or other means.

I get amped over things like trans visibility, STEM mentorship and pipeline access, and interactive data visualization and mapping. I love to bond over shared interests, so please reach out if any of this speaks to you!

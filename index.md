Hi, I’m Kai. People address me using they/them pronouns. I like to call myself an aspiring quantitative urbanist, or computational social scientist. In my career, my goal is to help bridge the divide between the social sciences and the computational and mathematical sciences. It is my desire to equip activists with the facts they need to fight for their causes, and communities with the information they need to better their lives.

I am passionate about finding ways to apply quantitative methods to social science topics such as economic geography and urban sociology. I care deeply about affecting systemic racial inequality in the United States. My research interests can be mostly bucketed into two camps: the measurement of nebulous things, and the process of neighborhood change. 

I believe it is extremely important to figure out the best ways to capture phenomena that don’t translate cleanly into numbers, such as segregation, gerrymandering, social capital, transportation access, and policing. I think it is crucial for researchers to define and measure these sometimes amorphous concepts as accurately as possible, otherwise we risk drawing the wrong conclusions or underestimating their true impacts on outcomes that matter to our lives.

It is also really important to me to understand neighborhood change better. I’m interested in the dynamics of neighborhood change-- how do we build up a neighborhood for the good of its community while keeping the community intact? How can we create and maintain truly integrated communities? I’m also curious about how geography matters-- how do our results change depending on the boundaries we draw? At what geographic level do urban processes occur? How does transportation infrastructure play into this? How do we prioritize equity and access in urban development processes?

I graduated from Vassar College in 2019, where my major was mathematics and my minor was urban studies. In my time at Vassar, I tried to accumulate what I believe is a quantitative social science toolset. I wrote a senior thesis in economics, which explored the relationship between the geographic shape of economic segregation and intergenerational mobility. 

Then, I spent two years as a predoctoral fellow at Harvard University’s <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org/">Opportunity Insights</a>, studying the dynamics of neighborhood economic opportunity in the United States. Now, I am seeking further opportunities in research and data visualization, ideally where I can gain more exposure to sociology and public policy. I plan to pursue a PhD within the next 2-5 years. 

I also get amped over things like trans visibility, STEM mentorship and pipeline access, and interactive data visualization and mapping. I love to bond over shared interests, so please reach out if any of this speaks to you!

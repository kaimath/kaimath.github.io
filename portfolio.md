Here you can find some of the projects I've worked on and cool things I've done, whether they've been for class, an internship, a competition, or just for fun.

Each Spring at Vassar, we hold a data competition called ASA DataFest. Hear about my team's experience from 2018 right <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/datafest/">here</a>. (I also designed the t-shirts and posters... See the design of the front of the t-shirt to your left-- reminiscent of the Vassar library!)

In the summer of 2017, I did research at the <a href="https://mtbi.asu.edu/">Mathematical and Theoretical Biology Institute</a>, which is part of the Simon A. Levin Mathematical, Computational and Modeling Sciences Center at Arizona State University. I worked as part of a team to develop a mathematical model of the relationship between public transit infrastructure and the spread of infectious disease, under Dr. Baojun Song of Montclair State University. Read our full manuscript <a href="https://mtbi.asu.edu/sites/default/files/manuscript.pdf">here</a>.

In the summer of 2016, I did research at the <a href="https://dataprivacylab.org/">Data Privacy Lab</a>, which is part of the Institute for Quantitative Social Science at Harvard University. Supervised by Dr. Latanya Sweeney, I worked on projects involving the  re-identification of supposedly "anonymized" datasets, construction of a new classification system for data-sharing relationships as part of theDataMap, and exposure of security flaws in government websites. My contributions to the latter are acknowledged in a <a href="https://techscience.org/a/2017090601/">paper</a> published in Data Privacy Lab's Journal of Technology Science.
